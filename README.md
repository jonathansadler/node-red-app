# Node-RED app (node-red-app)

A mobile app for node-RED

## Change user authentication to middleware for Dashboard

In `.node-red/settings.js`, comment out `httpNodeAuth` to remove basic authentication

Uncomment `ui`, change  to:

    ui: { 
    	path: "ui",
    	middleware: require("./dashboard-auth.js")
    },
Download [dashboard-auth.js](https://linhtranvu.github.io/node-red/dashboard-auth.js)Â , put in your `.node-red` folder (so `settings.js` and `dashboard-auth.js` in the same folder). Open file, change username and password to what you want
